# Portfolio

This portfolio showcases selected projects from my undergraduate studies and the first semester of my Master‚Äôs program, reflecting my evolving approach to thoughtful, human-centered design. From practical systems that support daily well-being to conceptual explorations that question future possibilities, my work balances creativity with critical inquiry.

<br>The number of hearing-impaired children is growing globally. With proper training, these children can regain their listening and communication skills. BeBe Song is a series of learning tools that combine a mobile app, an AR-enhanced stereoscopic book, and simple VR experiences to support language learning.In this project, I explored how **VR/AR as interactive technologies** can support the needs of **marginalized or special user groups**. The design process went beyond technical implementation, focusing on **addressing real-world challenges with empathy and relevance**.

<br>**Peony Picnic Flex** is a novel Chinese-style picnic service designed for **1‚Äì8 people**, crafted from **eco-friendly materials** such as **loofah** and **rice grains** to emphasize **sustainability**. Adaptable for various age groups, the **modular picnic box** transforms into a **backrest chair**, **baby seat**, or **picnic table**. It draws inspiration from **peony blossoms** and the **traditional Chinese wine game**, using **flowing water** to deliver food and evoke a sense of **poetic elegance**.


## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Qbao (QÂÆù).
