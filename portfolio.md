# Portfolio

This portfolio showcases selected projects from my undergraduate studies and the first semester of my Master‚Äôs program, reflecting my evolving approach to thoughtful, human-centered design. From practical systems that support daily well-being to conceptual explorations that question future possibilities, my work balances creativity with critical inquiry.

<br>The number of hearing-impaired children is growing globally. With proper training, these children can regain their listening and communication skills. BeBe Song is a series of learning tools that combine a mobile app, an AR-enhanced stereoscopic book, and simple VR experiences to support language learning.In this project, I explored how **VR/AR as interactive technologies** can support the needs of **marginalized or special user groups**. The design process went beyond technical implementation, focusing on **addressing real-world challenges with empathy and relevance**.

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].
