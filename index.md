## Research Interests

- Child-centered AI Design
- Interactive Design
- Digital Storytelling
- Gamification Strategies

My current research focuses on practical challenges in applying artificial intelligence to child-centered and interactive design. I am particularly interested in the use of interactive technologies and large language models (LLMs) to enhance user experiences in education and accessibility technologies.
